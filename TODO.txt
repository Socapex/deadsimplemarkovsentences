TODO:

- Multiple channels.
- Twitch API.
- Expose more options for software.
- (maybe) markov chains for sentences (context aware).

BUGS:
- She learns her own sentences, giving weight to incorrect stuff!!!!
-
- Speak function always outputs the same sentence.
- Fix recursion, by detecting same pivot words.
- Look into an empty database.
- Save file corruption (copy backup before save).
- If started with an empty database, will not speak even while the database is filling.
- Doesn't identify capital letter names.
